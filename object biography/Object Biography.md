# Object Biography

For Module 2 I decided to remix the vertices data from the 3d model of the Winston Churchill Toby Jug I created in Module 1. I chose to remix the data into sound, in order to create a new way in which the data of the object could be understood. In taking the data from a 3d model and editing it in order to turn it into sound, the core aspect of the object remains the same while the visual result is transformed into an audio one. 

I felt that turning the data into sound through [Musical Algorithms](http://www.musicalgorithms.org/3.2/), allowed for the orinigal object itself to become even more accessible. As hearing the object data allows for an additional understanding of the 3d model as well as the original Jug. The sonification is only a representation of the first 100 vertices of the model, allowing a snapshot of the possibilities of the entire model. 

The final result is a 21 second song which shows the ways the vertices of the model interact with each other. Providing a new way of seeing/hearing the Churchill Jug through sound rather than sight, or as an accompaniment to the 3d model.
