After trying the sonification using the first 25 values, I decided to make it longer by using the first 100 values. 
- I once again formatted the values into three rows in excell
- I then inputted them in [Musical Algorithms](http://www.musicalgorithms.org/3.2/) 
- I decided to use the first to decimal places as the numbers for each value in the first two rows:
    - So 4.881039 became 88, and so on
- The third row didn't work when I did the first two decimal places, so I removed the decimals alltogether:
    - So -14.022264 became -14 
- I then edited the scales, keys, and instruments of each voice
- I listened to the sonification and changed the tempo to 85 bpm
- I then saved the MIDI file and the CSV file of my sonification
