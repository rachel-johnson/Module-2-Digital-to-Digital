I looked at the instructions provided in the FAQ [How do I sonify the data I created in Module 1?](https://github.com/shawngraham/hist3812w18/wiki/How-do-I-sonify-the-data-I-created-in-Module-1%3F) by Shawn Graham:

- I began by trying to locate the obj. file for my 3d model
- When I downloaded my model from sketchfab it didn't provide the obj. file
- I then returned to the original work I did in Photoscan and was able to find the obj. file of my model
- I opened the obj. file in Notepad++ in order to view the vertices
- It provided both 'v' and 'vn' values which appeared like this:
    - v 4.881039 1.672435 -14.022264
vn -0.851556 -0.110387 -0.512511
v 4.833768 1.689318 -13.936163
vn -0.900321 -0.086873 -0.426468
v 4.869221 1.640358 -13.990187
vn -0.872302 -0.071370 -0.483731
v 4.869221 1.582958 -13.939540
vn -0.777533 -0.309426 -0.547447
v 4.847274 1.694383 -13.968240
vn -0.855501 -0.253482 -0.451514  
- I decided to only use the 'v' vertices for the sonification
