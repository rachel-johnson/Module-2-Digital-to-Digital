# Figuring Things Out

I started to organise the 'v' values:
- I copied the first 50 values into another Notepad++ document
- I then removed the 'vn' values, and ended up with 25 'v' values
- Then I changed the data from three columns into three rows by copying them into excell
- I then copied these rows of data individually into the Pitch Input of [Musical Algorithms](http://www.musicalgorithms.org/3.2/) 
- I played around with different decimal places and ways of representing the values


I found that using 25 values was too short and decided to create a longer final sonified piece.
