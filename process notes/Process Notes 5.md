# Finalizing my Sonification

I realized I needed to convert the MIDI file created using [Musical Algorithms](http://www.musicalgorithms.org/3.2/):

- I looked at the list of files which could be uploaded to [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/stream)
- I decided to convert my MIDI file to a WAV file
- After converting the file, I uploaded it to my [Soundcloud Account](https://soundcloud.com/user-994863578/sonified-churchill)

I found that the sonification was better with more data, as it is longer and can allow for greater insight into the data
